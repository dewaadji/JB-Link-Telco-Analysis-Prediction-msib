# JB Link Telco Analysis and Prediction MSIB

This project is the Final Project of the MSIB program at PT GreatEdu Global Mahardika. We were asked to analyze and predict the customer churn of a telecommunication company.

We use the CRISP-DM concept in completing this project where the process of the CRISP-DM concept includes:

1. Business Understanding, 
2. Data Understanding, 
3. Data Preprocessing, 
4. Exploratory Data Analysis, 
5. Modeling, 
6. Deployment/Business Recommendation.

Based on the modeling results that we have done, the Business Recommendations that we provide are:

- Provide special treatment to customers with Tenure < 12 Months such as 30% discount for the first 1 year subscription to keep customers subscribed to the company's services.
- Improve services on Internet Service such as improving network quality to attract customers to subscribe, as well as giving bonus Device Protection Plan if customers subscribe to Fiber Optic Internet Type.
- Provide offers to customers with Month-to-Month Contract type to switch to One-Year Contract with a bonus of one Extra service of Customer's choice to avoid Churn.
- Making Customers with Monthly Charge above $70 become High Value Customers, special treatment obtained such as quick response to reported issues or being the first Customer to be offered Extra Service promos so that Customers remain loyal to the Company.
- Increase responsibility for issue reports from customers because Customer Svc Requests greatly affect Churn.
